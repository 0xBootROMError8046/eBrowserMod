# eShopBrowser
Redirects the eShop's error page (when using a dns to block Nintendo's servers, for example 90DNS) to google.com

Here's a little mod I made to be able to enjoy and use the internal browser. This probably only is for the people who block Nintendo's servers. 
This just replaces one out of three errorpages with a page that rediricts to google.com, and replaces the original eShop domain whitelist to allow all domains.

* Launching the eShop unfortunately still starts loading until it times out. I'll see if there's a fix for that in the future.
* Screenshots cannot be taken
* No cursor, only the select box.

You can change the icon of the eShop by modifying __Combined.bntx in ResidentMenu.szs.
